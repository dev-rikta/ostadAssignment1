PHP Mini Projects
Project 1: Number Classifier
Make a PHP script that checks a number. First, check if the number is positive or negative. Then, check if the number is even or odd.

Take input or define variable


Show output like: "The number -4 is Negative and Even".


Project 2: Temperature Converter
Make a PHP script that takes temperature input or static variable and converts it between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Celsius to Fahrenheit: (celsius * 9/5) + 32


Fahrenheit to Celsius: (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9


Project 3: Basic Auth System
Create a PHP script with a hardcoded username and password.

Set variables like $username = "admin" and $password = "1234".


Create another sets of variable with inputUsername and inputPassword.


Check if both match, show "Login Successful", otherwise show "Invalid username or password".


Project 4: Simple Electricity Bill Calculator
Make a PHP script to calculate the electricity bill based on the number of units entered.

If units are less than or equal to 50: bill = units * 3.50
If units are less than or equal to 100: bill = 50 * 3.50 + (units - 50) * 4.00
If units are less than or equal to 200: bill = 50 * 3.50 + 50*  4.00 + (units - 100) * 5.20
If units are more than 200 means else case: bill = 50* 3.50 + 50 * 4.00 + 100 * 5.20 + (units - 200) * 6.50

Show the total amount clearly with a message.
